          Launched in 2010, Chego started out originally as a test kitchen for the KogiBBQ Korean taco trucks.
          However, the kitchen had a complete wok station, oven, and deep fryer left over from the previous owners
          of the space.  The gears began turning in the mind of Chef Roy Choi and he decided that beyond being a
          simple test kitchen, this would become a full fledged restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chef Roy Choi drew upon inspiration from his child hood when he would have to make lunch for himself with rice,
          left overs, and an egg.  Left overs would range from Thai, Mexican, Chinese, Korean, and just about any other
          dish that his parents would bring home.  Many times left overs would be mixed together to create different flavor
          combinations to create variety in the young chef's meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this concept, Chef Roy recycled many of the sauces and marinades used for the KogiBBQ menu and repurposed them
          into the rice bowls on the menu today.  Like Kogi, the menu of Chego draws upon influences from all accross from LA from
          K-Town to Thai Town to China Town to the Mexican street carts dotted around the city.

          Chego relocated to China Town LA in May of 2013 and now currently resides in the middle of the Far East Plaza at 727 N. Broadway,
          Los Angeles, CA 90017.
